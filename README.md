# android-template
My starter template for Android app

## How to clone this template

1. Download a copy of this repo.

2. In Android Studio, refactor (rename) the application to your app.

3. In Android Studio, don't rename the package name. Create your desired package name, and refactor move to the new package. Delete the old one.

4. The Android Annotation reference you have will not get refactored, so manually "remane all" from "clone.me" to your new package name.

5. Set your application name in ```strings.xml```.

## Check

* ```build.gradle``` ```applicationId``` is correctly named to your package.

* ```manifest package``` is correctly named to your package in ```AndroidManifest```.

You can now do a build.
